        Dear Taku, I have a small confession. Forgive this pouring of my heart.
        I cherish Cavite, where we first met. The moment I clapped eyes on you,
        I knew you were going to be a pretty friend. Recently, I have began to
        regard you as much more than just a pretty friend. My feelings for you
        intensified when I saw you singing in the moonlight. I was further wowed
        by your tremendous playing video games skills. You have eyes like smart
        carrots and the most lovely face I've ever seen. When I look at you, I
        just want to hugs those smart carrot eyes and kisses that lovely face.
        You're so special with your ghoster ways. The way you handle your yes
        crush shows great kindess and patience. I know that to you I'm just a
        good at bedwars boy but I think we could be happy together, sleeping
        like two handsome cats. Please, say you'll be mine Taku! All my love
        Janelle
